## ⚙️ System Design and Architecture

### Functional Requirements
Describe **what** the system must do.
- Example: Users can register and log in securely.  
- Example: The system generates weekly analytics reports.

### Non-Functional Requirements
Performance, security, usability, scalability, and maintainability criteria.

### Use Cases / User Stories
Provide 2–4 key use cases or user stories.  
Optionally include a diagram (`/docs/use_cases.png`).

### System Architecture
High-level overview of the system components and interactions.  
Embed your architecture diagram here:
